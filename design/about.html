	<p> My name is Elizabeth Price, I am software and web designer. I graduated for Northampton Community College with my Associates in Computer Science in May 2016. Currently, I am studying for my degree in Web development also at NCC. Spring 2018 is my predicted graduation time. In my free time I like to make art with photoshop and other adobe software. I create web pages and programs with the coding languages I have learned over my education.</p>

	<p> I got interested in web design during my senior year of high school. After taking a introduction course in Web development. However, when I started college I majored in computer Science. I loved the idea that with Computer Science and Web Design that art and technology could be combined into one major. I am very proud of myself for what I have accomplished in that major. It took me two semesters longer than thought to complete my Associates, but the learning process gave me motivation. I am very proud of myself to have earned my degree. After graduation in 2017, I decided to come back to NCC and earn another Associates degree but this time in web development. I wanted to continue my education in order to expand my skills with coding languages.
